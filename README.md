This project is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard)

I only used Html and CSS grid. Images are hosted with Cloudinary cdn.

This is my Admin Dashboard from TheOdinProject.
I chose to add some personal elements I like with a nice video background and gradient text effect.
